<h2>Our Adoption Journey</h2>

<p>We started our adoption journey in February, 2002, and the next February we 
were home from Russia with Mila, age 3 1/2, and Elena, age 23 months. We had been expecting to 
add only one daughter to our family, between the ages of 0-18 months. During our 
first trip to Apatity to visit Elena, we were surprised and delighted to learn 
that Elena's older sister would not be placed in a permanent foster family as 
we had been told earlier. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, not long after we heard the exciting news, we were then told that Mila was not, and  never 
would be made available for international adoption. Mila's paperwork had not 
been returned nor posted on the international waiting list. She was in a different 
city, Kovdor, (although luckily the same region of Murmansk) and in an orphanage 
from which no American agency had ever adopted children. </p>
<p>Through our perseverance and the tireless efforts of our agency and their 
contacts in Murmansk, we were eventually granted our wish, and a judge in 
Murmansk accepted our petition to also adopt Mila. Though our second trip to 
bring Elena home was delayed by perhaps as much as 2 months, we were allowed to 
bring Mila home after only one trip to Kovdor instead of the usual two, and the extra 10-day required 
wait period after our court date was also waived. </p>

<p>MAPS International (Maine Adoption Placement Services), we love you! Our 
beautiful daughters would never have been brought together without your 
expertise. We are also forever grateful for the love and care both girls were given 
by their respective institutions. 
Elena at the Baby Home in Apatity, and especially Mila at the Kovdor Children's 
Home.&nbsp; It is a wonderful orphanage, we cannot say enough good things about 
it, or its Director, Luba. Both children had clearly been treated with respect and love. </p>
<p>To top off all our good fortune, we have just recently learned that as a 
result of Mila's placement in our family, another Massachusetts couple is 
waiting to bring home their son from the same Kovdor Children's Home, and 
remarkably, Mila's same play group.</p>
<p>A special thank you, too, to Matthew and Harlan, big brother and sister, for 
welcoming these little (messy, very messy) people in your lives all the while 
facing your own teenage challenges. We love you for the grace, generosity, and 
kindness you've shown through the huge transition. We are absolutely busting 
with pride at the remarkable young adults you have become.</p>
<p>Much love, </p>
